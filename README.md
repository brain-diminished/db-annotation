# Database Annotations

This package proposes a way to easily interpret annotations in your database comments (columns and tables). This may be
particularly useful when using an ORM driven by the database schema, as it would allow to hint some specific behaviours
(default order in table, specific modifier on a column, etc.) without breaking its philosophy.
